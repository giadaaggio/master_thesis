## Astophysics and Cosmology tools

This repository contains a collection of Python tools developed during my master's thesis in astrophysics and cosmology. The primary focus of these tools is the analysis of star clusters, with an emphasis on the morphology of the horizontal branch and the impact of binary fractions. These scripts are designed to be quite flexible, customizable, and applicable to various star clusters.
