# Variations of the Fraction of Binaries outside the Main Sequence
This repository contains a collection of Python tools developed during my master's thesis in astrophysics and cosmology. The primary focus of these tools is the analysis of star clusters and building synthetic binary systems to extend the analysis of the fraction of binaries to unexplored regions of the CMD. These scripts are designed to be quite flexible, customizable, and applicable to various star clusters.

The tools I developed are: 

- _**binary_utils**_ contains the class _**BinaryStarUtils**_ which can be used to build synthetic binary systems and to color code these systems in order to present them in a CMD. 
- _**CMDAnalyzer**_ contains classes to interactively select regions and fiducial lines in a CMD plot.

In _**TOTORO**_ there are both the files I used in my work and the Jupyter Notebooks I employed during the data reduction and data analysis.
